text = "Tactician is a 2D strategy game that takes place on a battlefield between two armies. Your army, which consists of 
several units placed in the beginning of the game, can only see so far into the fog of war that dominates the map.
You must use your units wisely to take space on the board and eliminate the enemy.

The game progresses in a turn system, where every turn the player can move their units and use their units’ 
abilities. There are three units:

Knight - the most basic unit, with average stats and a decent normal attack
Archer - a ranged unit, with the ability to attack units far away
Scout - a fast but weak unit, with the ability to see far into the fog of war

Unit statistics:
Cost: How many energy points the unit costs to play
HP: Number of health points the unit has. They can take this much damage before dying
Movement range: How far the unit can travel on each turn
Attack Range: The unit can attack enemies this many spaces away
Damage: Each attack from the unit will deal this much damage to the target
Vision Range: How far the unit can see into the fog of war


How to Play:

In the beginning of the game, players use their energy to place units on the board, setting a basis for the rest of
the game. Each player has the same amount of energy, and can choose whatever combination of units they want. After both players place their units, the game starts.

During each turn, the player can click on any given hex to get its information. By clicking on an ally unit, they can
see where it can move and any targets it can attack. Players can then select attacks, see their description, and
choose to use them. They can also move the unit to a new location, using the units movement resource, which
resets at the end of the turn. Players can end their turn by clicking the ‘End Turn’ button.

The game ends when one player is out of units. Good luck!
